      "The western tip of Cyprus is an area known as the Akamas Peninsula, and it is one of the least-inhabited parts of the island. If youâ€™re eager to get off the beaten track, then this is the place to be: There are literally no paved roads! As a result, it is ideal for hiking or mountain biking. It is also an amazing place for spotting wildlife, just some of which can include sea turtles, reptiles and native birds. You can also explore the history of the Akamas Peninsula with a visit to the Agios Andronikos, a former mosque and current church that was constructed in the early 16th century."
